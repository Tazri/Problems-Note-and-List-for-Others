# Chapter 03 : üß± Types of Loops in C++

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **`for` Loop**

The `for` loop is best when the number of iterations is known.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

üîπ Components:

- Initialization ‚Üí `int i = 0`
- Condition ‚Üí `i < 10`
- Update ‚Üí `i++`
  The loop runs **as long as the condition is true**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **`while` Loop**

The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown.

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

Runs **only when the condition is true** from the start.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **`do...while` Loop**

Executes at least once, **even if the condition is false**.

```cpp
int i = 0;
do {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
} while (i < 10);
```

‚úÖ Use it when the loop **must execute once no matter what**.

## üéØ Key Concepts to Master

### üîÅ Loop Control Statements

### üî∏ `break`

Used to **exit the loop immediately**.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) break;
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

### üî∏ `continue`

Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) continue;
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

---

### üß† Infinite Loops

Be careful not to create a loop that never ends:

```cpp
while (true) {
    // Will run forever unless broken manually
}
```

Use only with clear break conditions!

---

### üîÑ Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 2; j++) {
        cout << "(" << i << "," << j << ") ";
    }
}
```

Used for grids, matrices, pairwise comparisons, etc.

‚õî Be careful: **nested loops can cause TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)** if total iterations are too large.

---

### üßÆ Loop Variable Scope

Variables declared inside a loop exist **only inside that loop**:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
// i is not accessible here
```

## ü™Ñ Competitive Programming Tips & Tricks

### üí° 1. **Loop Bounds Matter**

Always double-check `i <= n` vs `i < n`. An off-by-one can cause WA or TLE.

### üí° 2. **Use `-i` Instead of `i--` (Micro-optimization)**

```cpp
for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) // slightly faster
```

This is a micro-optimization. Rarely needed, but fun fact.

### üí° 3. **Speed Up Loops with Bit Shifting**

Instead of `i *= 2`:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i <<= 1)
```

Faster and cleaner! Works great when iterating over powers of 2.

### üí° 4. **Avoid Unnecessary Conditions Inside Loop**

If possible, **move `if` logic outside the loop** or redesign loop bounds to skip unnecessary checks.

### üí° 5. **Break Early in Searching**

If you're looking for something in a loop (like a minimum or a match), don‚Äôt scan the whole thing if not needed‚Äîbreak as soon as found.

### üí° 6. **Avoid Nested Loops for Large `n`**

If `n` is 10^5+, avoid nested loops. They cause TLE. Instead, try prefix sums, maps, or math tricks.
