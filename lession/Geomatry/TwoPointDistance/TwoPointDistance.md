# Two Point Distance

Type of two point distance :

- Eucleadian Distance
- Squared Eucleadian Distance
- Manhatten Distance
- Chebyshe Distance or Kings Move Distance

---

### Eucleadian Distance

If two point is :
A = (x1,y1)
B = (x2,y2)

Eucleadian Distance :

```cpp
distance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2);
```

---

### Squared Eucleadian Distance

If two point is :
A = (x1,y1)
B = (x2,y2)

Eucleadian Distance :

```cpp
distance = (x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2;
```
