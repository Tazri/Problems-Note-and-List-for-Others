# Part 1

- Distance between two point
- Midpoint
- Slope
- Equation of line
- parallel/perpedicular condition
- Line Equation

# Part 2

- Vector Basic
- Dot Product
  - when dot > 0 -> acute angle
  - when dot < 0 -> obtuse angle
  - When dot = 0 -> 90 degree
- Cross Product
  - Orientation
    - \> 0 -> counter clockwise
    - < 0 -> clockwise
    - = 0 -> colinear
  - Area of triangle
    - Area = |cross|/2
  - Segment Intersection
  - Polygon Area
  - Convex Hull logic

# Part 3

check if

- If point lies on segment ?
- If two point segments intersects ?
- Find polygon area using shoelace formula
- Distance from point to line.
- Projection formula
- on segment check

# part 4

Convex Hull

- Andrew Monotone Chain - using sorting - using cross product
  undertand :
- why we remove points when cross <= 0
- Why hull is outer bundary ?
- Why sorting works ?

solve :

- Perimeter of convex hull.
- Area of convex hull
- Maximum Distance diameter

# Part 5

- Rotating calipers
  - for diameter
  - maximum area triangle
- closest pair of point [ divide & conquer]
- projection of point on line
- reflection
- distance from point to line

# Part 6

- Line Sweeping
- Half plane Intersection
- Minkowski sum
- Geometry binary search
- Geometry DP
